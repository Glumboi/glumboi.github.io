		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Welcome to the documentation for the creation of GlumSak Plugins.</p>
		<h2 id="Getting Started">Getting Started</h2>
		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		<p>In order to create GlumSak Plugins, you will need 
      <a href="https://github.com/Glumboi/GlumSak-Plugin-Template">Template for GlumSak Plugins</a>
      :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Windows 10 or later</li>
			<li>The .NET Framework 4.8.1 or later</li>
			<li>Basic C# Knowledge</li>
      <li>Visual Studio 2017 or greater</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="Creating a Plugin">Creating a Plugin</h3>
		<p>Demo of a basic GlumSak Plugin which shows a MessageBox with a given Parameter:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-csharp">
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.Reflection;
        
namespace GlumSak_PluginTemplate
{
      public class Plugin
      {
            public static int exitCode;
        
            public static int PluginEntryPoint(object[] args) //--> Default Entrypoint of the Plugin
            {
                  if (args.Length > 0 &&
                      args[0] is bool &&
                      (bool)args[0] == true)
                  {
                      AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ProcessExit
                         += OverrrideExitEvent; //--> Use custom ExitEvent if first param is bool and true
                  }
        
                  //Your custom code here, you can also use WindowsForms with this (WPF might be possible too)
                  MessageBox.Show(args[1].ToString());

                  exitCode = 0;
                  return exitCode;
            }
        
            private static void OverrrideExitEvent(object sender, EventArgs e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Plugin {Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().FullName} exited with code: {exitCode}");
                Console.ReadKey();
            }
      }
}
      </code>
    </pre>
		<h3 id="Creating a Plugin-ini">I finished the code and compiled it to a DLL, what now?</h3>
		<p>In order to let GlumSak know that there is a Plugin you need to create an .ini File for your Plugin<br>
    Here is how an .ini File for the above Plugin would look like:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-ini">
[GlumSakPlugin]

;Name of the Plugin that is going to be displayed in GlumSak
PluginName=MessageBoxDemo
        
;Entry point that GlumSak tries to execute
Entrypoint=PluginEntryPoint
        
;Class of the Entrypoint
Class=Plugin
        
;Namespace of the Entrypoint-class
Namespace=GlumSak_PluginTemplate
        
;Parameters of plugin
Params=false,Hello World!
        
;Icon of the Plugin
PluginIcon=
      </code>
    </pre>
		<h3>What are the fields all doing?</h3>
    <h4>1. PluginName
      <p>This Field holds the Name of your Plugin, make sure that it doesnt contain any spaces or special character</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>2. Entrypoint
      <p>This Field holds the Name of the Plugin's Entrypoint, in our case we want it to be called 'PluginEntryPoint'.<br>
      Please note, this can be changed to any Name that you gave the Entrypoint.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>3. Class
      <p>This Field holds the Class-Name of your Plugin where your Entrypoint sits in.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>4. Namespace
      <p>This Field holds the Namespace-Name of your Plugin where the Class and Entrypoint sit in.</p>
    </h4>
    <h4>5. Params
      <p>This Field holds the Parameters (an object array) of the Entrypoint, the first value of the object array is always reserved for the override of the Exit-Event.<br>
      <br>
        In our exapmle, we used false and Hello World! as Parameters.<br>
      false in this Case means: No we dont want to override the Exit-Event.<br>
      <br>
      Hello World! is our string argument that we want to show in out MessageBox, we convert it to a string in the code in order to use it as one.<br>
      <br>
      Note that the parameters are all stored as objects thus they can be convert to basically any value, array parameters are not supported!
    </h4>
    <h4>6. PluginIcon
      <p>This Field holds the Icon of your Plugin which is going to be displayed in GlumSak, I did not set any rules for the design Theme, Height or Width. You can put any Image here basically. Can be left empty if no Icon is used<br>
      Make sure that the Name really only contains the Name+file ending of the Icon</p>
    </h4>
    </pre>
    <h3>I've done everything above, what now?</h3>
		<p>Once compiled and set up, grab all the required file of your Plugin and put them in a Folder which can be called anything (Plugin Name as Folder Name recommended).<br>
    Once that's done, you can move the Folder in the Plugins Folder of GlumSak which sits in the Directory where it got installed to!</p>
    <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion and last Words</h3>
		<p>These Plugins are still a BETA and are not done and are not supposed to be anything significant, rather a gimmic.<br><br>
    Executing other languages with DLLImport and so on can be possible but are not officially tested!<br><br>
    Winforms UI's are supported and work perfectly, Console based Plugins won't work because of the way .NET handles certain things.<br>This doesnt mean that it's impossible though, if you are smarter than I am then you can surely find a way to make it possible.<br>
    WPF and other XAML based UI Frameworks are not verified/tested for support!
    <br>
    <br>
    Interaction between GlumSak's code and the Plugin won't be possible due to Security risks.
